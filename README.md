## Description
This application is a nice little workday calender that will save your activities for the day and display the current hour. The past and future hours are highlighted in gray and green, respectively. On a new day, the activities are cleared.
<br>
## Tools Used
A CSS/html basic page structure was provided by UCB Bootcamp. I used javascript and Bootstrap to dynamically generate the time rows and populate them with local storage data.
